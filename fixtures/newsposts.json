That means the sensors can operate in spite of shadows or bright light reflected off surfaces like wet roads, the spokesperson added. And lidar can see farther and in more detail than people can in low-light situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Humans drive with their eyes and ears,\" Goff said. \"But radar systems cut through fog and snow without too much trouble.\" AVs can precisely calculate the length of distance needed to stop and how much room to give other vehicles, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heavy rain can disrupt radar, however. A study published in IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine found \"severe rainfall conditions\" can reduce a radar's detection range by up to 55%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Waymo, each sensor compliments the others, providing vehicles with a richer view of the world. That makes them safer and more capable than humans, a spokesperson said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"A camera's ability is restricted in weather, poor lighting and when trying to see around corners. That's why it's helpful to have Lidar and radar to complement the cameras,\" the Waymo spokesperson said. \"We also have a number of innovative cleaning tools like wipers and nozzles to ensure the Waymo Driver [autonomy system] can always see through any condition.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn't mean AVs can drive in every type of adverse condition. They may need to pull over in extreme weather, just like humans do, Goff said. But with humans, the decision to wait out a storm is generally a judgment call.</p>", "source": "https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/weather-autonomous-truck-av-oem-kodiak-torc-robotics-waymo/601042/", "is_cover_story": false, "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "divesite": 13, "topics": [4, 12, 18, 19]}}, {"model": "news.newspost", "pk": 16, "fields": {"title": "FedEx, Nuro sign multi-year deal to test autonomous last-mile delivery", "body": "<p>FedEx is expanding its portfolio of last-mile technology through a \"multi-year, multi-phase agreement\" with Nuro to test autonomous delivery vehicles, the carrier announced Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Kicking off with testing in Houston, this program allows Nuro and FedEx to explore high value use cases, including multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries,\" a spokesperson from FedEx said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The testing began in \"several Houston zip codes in April\" and may expand to additional cities over time, a spokesperson from Nuro said in an email.
